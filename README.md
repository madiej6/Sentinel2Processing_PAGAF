# Sentinel2Processing_PAGAF
This repository contains the scripts for a geoprocessing workflow in Python for generating Nitrogen Sufficiency Index (SI) geotiffs from a set of 17 Sentinel-2 images collected over Adair County, IA throughout the 2017 corn season (03/2017 - 09/2017). These geotiffs will be used to inform farmers how much Nitrogen to give to their corn in NLT's open source PAGAF web application (https://pagaf.nltmso.com/), depending on how far along they are in the growing season.
